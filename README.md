Hello this is my app Dr Chungus

I created it because I wanted to teach people about physics.

Normally advanced physics requires more advanced mathematics to study however I thought it would be cool to make a simplified version.

My hand written courses intend to inform the reader about topic which most people find interesting like quantum mechanics or general relativity. 

People can pass the courses by taking a quiz

There is also a mathematics portion of my app

There is a built in function grapher and some numerical methods

I added 4 numerical methods which the user can play around with to solve problems such as finding roots, computing definite integrals, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors and solving matricies,

This is a project I really love so I will keep adding to it over time and improve it beyond what it currently is.

I hope you like it. If you really love physics and math I'm sure you'll feel right at home.
